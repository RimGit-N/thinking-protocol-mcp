Hey everyone! 👋

I just published **thinking-protocol-mcp**, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements a structured 6-stage thinking framework for AI agents.

## What is it?

A systematic approach to problem-solving that guides AI agents through:

1. **OBSERVE** - Capture objective inputs only
2. **ANALYZE** - Derive meaning and context
3. **ROOT** - Identify true underlying cause
4. **ACT** - Define actionable decisions
5. **VALIDATE** - Verify outcome and correctness
6. **IMPROVE** - Prevent recurrence and strengthen system

## Why use it?

- ✅ Enforces systematic thinking (no shortcuts!)
- ✅ Perfect for complex problem-solving
- ✅ Root cause analysis
- ✅ Architectural decisions
- ✅ Security analysis
- ✅ Performance optimization

## Installation

```bash
# Via NPM
npm install -g thinking-protocol-mcp

# Via NPX (no installation)
npx -y thinking-protocol-mcp
```

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

### Version 1: Professional
```
🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project!

I've just published thinking-protocol-mcp - a Model Context Protocol server that brings systematic thinking to AI agents.

🎯 The Challenge:
AI agents are powerful, but often lack structured problem-solving approaches. They might skip critical analysis steps or miss root causes.

✅ The Solution:
A 6-stage thinking framework that enforces:
• OBSERVE - Objective data capture
• ANALYZE - Context derivation
• ROOT - Root cause identification
• ACT - Actionable decision-making
• VALIDATE - Outcome verification
• IMPROVE - Continuous improvement

🔧 Perfect for:
• Complex problem-solving
• Root cause analysis
• Architectural decisions
• Security analysis
• Performance optimization

📦 Available now on NPM:
npm install -g thinking-protocol-mcp

⭐ Open source (MIT License)
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/RimGit-N/thinking-protocol-mcp

Would love to hear your thoughts! Have you faced similar challenges with AI agents?

## 🌐 Hacker News "Show HN" Post

**Title:**
```
Show HN: thinking-protocol-mcp – 6-stage thinking framework for AI agents
```

**Body:**
```
Hi HN! 👋

I built thinking-protocol-mcp, a Model Context Protocol server that enforces systematic thinking for AI agents.

## The Problem

AI agents are powerful but often lack structured problem-solving. They might skip analysis, miss root causes, or make unvalidated decisions.

## The Solution

A mandatory 6-stage framework:
1. OBSERVE - Objective data only
2. ANALYZE - Context & patterns
3. ROOT - True underlying cause
4. ACT - Actionable decisions
5. VALIDATE - Verify outcomes
6. IMPROVE - Prevent recurrence

No shortcuts allowed - all stages must be completed in order.

## Use Cases

- Root cause analysis
- Architectural decisions
- Security analysis
- Performance optimization
- Complex debugging

## Tech

- Node.js >=18.0.0
- Model Context Protocol SDK
- Session-based state management
- MIT License

## Links

NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/thinking-protocol-mcp
GitHub: https://github.com/RimGit-N/thinking-protocol-mcp

Would love feedback from the HN community! What other thinking frameworks would be useful for AI agents?
